# Code Refactor Starter Code
=======
# UCF-Week-1
This is my first challenge for UCF Bootcamp
I refactored some code for a website called Horiseon. 
I changed a lot of the css selectors, added notes describing use for code, and I made it more accessible. 


Following are 2 screenshots of the application
